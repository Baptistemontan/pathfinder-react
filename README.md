this is an amateur project to learn react
this code is hardcore based on event
the first try at making this work I hurt a big wall at 400km/h when I tried to make the animation
I was rerendering the entire grid for every node animation
I could here the lag
so I had to find a way to render only the node itself
so I redesigned the whole project and used custom event to tell the node when she can change her state
and it work like a charm
I hope my code is comprehensible, I try my best to explain whats on my mind but you know what programming is

feel free to use my code and to modify it, and I'm open for suggestion for improvement
