This is an amateur project to learn react, I hope my code is not that much incomprehensible. My goal is to implement Dijkstra/A\* algorithm (and more if i have the motivation, but if the UI and all those suff is already done it must be easy) and have an UI were you can move the nodes around and put walls/weights and visualize what the algorithm is actually doing. I also implemented a maze generator.

Next step from now is to implement a third node, wich the algorithm will first go to and then from there find the end node

Feel free to use my code and to modify it, and I'm open for suggestion for improvement
